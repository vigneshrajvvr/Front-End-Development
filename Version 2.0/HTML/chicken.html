        <p>The <b>(Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). 
            Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total <b>population of 23.7 billion</b> as of
            2018 up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated 
            fowl. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.
