    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Paragraph 1</h2>
    <p>
        The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue, because it uses the copper-containing protein haemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of the red, 
        iron-containing protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood. The blood is pumped by three separate hearts: 
        two branchial hearts pump blood to the cuttlefish's pair of gills (one heart for each), and the third pumps blood around the rest of the body. 
        Cuttlefish blood must flow more rapidly than that of most other animals because haemocyanin carries substantially less oxygen than haemoglobin. 
        Unlike most other mollusks, cephalopods like cuttlefish have a closed circulatory system.
